# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The scope for this project is to clean the missing data and make some meaningful interpretation of the available information.

## Process
The common attributes across the tables were mapped.
The attributes with less and no values were identified.

## Results
Inferences were drawn after mapping the attributes.

## Challenges 
It was a herculean task to code the tables.

## Future Goals
A deeper mapping of the attributes will enable logical inferences to be made.
